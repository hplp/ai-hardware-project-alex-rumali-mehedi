The MATLAB code is designed to analyze EEG data to detect sleep apnea episodes. It begins by reading an EDF file containing EEG signals from a specific subject and extracting data from two channels, C3A2 and C4A1. These channels are combined through averaging to create a single signal for further analysis. The preprocessing phase involves applying a Butterworth bandpass filter to isolate frequency bands commonly associated with sleep stages: delta, theta, alpha, sigma, and beta. The code then segments the EEG data into normal and apnea periods based on the start and end times provided in an associated Excel file. This segmentation allows for targeted analysis of specific signal intervals.

For feature extraction, the code computes various statistical and signal-based parameters, including energy, kurtosis, skewness, interquartile range (IQR), activity, mobility, mean absolute deviation (MAD), and complexity. These features are calculated separately for normal and apnea segments across all frequency bands, capturing the distinct characteristics of the EEG signals during different states. The extracted features are organized into matrices, which serve as inputs for further analysis or machine learning models.

The code also includes a quantization step to prepare the EEG signals for compatibility with hardware implementation or low-precision processing. Finally, processed signals and feature data for delta and beta bands are saved into text files, enabling further analysis.
